This error means your local branch is behind the remote branch (there are changes on GitHub
 that you don't have locally). Here's how to fix it:
Option 1: Pull First, Then Push (Recommended)
1. Pull the remote changes:
cmd git pull origin main
2. If there are merge conflicts, resolve them, then:
cmd git add .
git commit -m "Merge remote changes"
3. Push your changes:
cmd git push -u origin main
Option 2: Force Push (Only if you want to overwrite remote changes)
⚠️ Warning: This will delete any changes that exist on GitHub but not on your local machine.
cmd git push -u origin main --force
Option 3: Check What's Different First
1. See what's on the remote that you don't have:
cmd git fetch origin
git log HEAD..origin/main --oneline
2. See what you have locally that's not on remote:
cmd git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline
This helps you understand what changes will be merged.
Most Common Scenario:
If you created the repository on GitHub with a README file or license, and you're now trying
 to push your local project, you need to pull those files first.

If you just created the repository:
1. Initialize git (if not done):
cmd git init
2. Add your files:
cmd git add .
3. Commit:
cmd git commit -m "Initial commit"
4. Add remote:
cmd git remote add origin https://github.com/toniassul/POO.git
5. Push:
cmd git push -u origin main

1. Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@gmail.com"

# 2. Start ssh-agent and add key
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# 3. Copy public key to add to GitHub
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# 4. Test connection
ssh -T git@github.com

# 5. Try pushing again
git push origin main
